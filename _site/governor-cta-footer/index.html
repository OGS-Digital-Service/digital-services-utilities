<div style="margin:50px;"><p> Key differences here are that the link for the logo has a focus and hover of #FACE00 because it needs some visual identifier, things are more centered at mobile and responsive below tablet, and any general width constraints are gone (Ex. no 1160px container issue). 
</p><br>
<p>There are almost all min-widths removed, no relative positioning, no other weird constrains of containers. Things are properly grouped as they should be in wrappers or containers and tab order is preserved and logical.</p></div>
